# Brand Voice

Critical Start speaks with clarity, warmth, and confident expertise. We remove jargon, explain security concepts plainly, and stay grounded in verifiable outcomes.

## Principles
- **Talk like people talk.** We speak with customers, not at them. Favor plain English, avoid buzzwords, and make even technical explanations approachable.
- **Confidence without arrogance.** We state facts about our expertise and results without boasting. Let proof points create separation from competitors.
- **Authenticity above all else.** No exaggeration or hyperbole. Be candid about what we do, why it matters, and how we partner.

## Language Mechanics
- Always use Oxford commas.
- When acronyms or abbreviations appear, spell them out the first time unless the audience is confirmed to understand them.
- Use the approved casing: Cybersecurity (one word), cyber-attack (hyphenated), and cyber risk (two words).
- Stay human: contractions are welcome, and humor is fine when it’s helpful and on-brand.

## Tone Guardrails
We balance:
- Human, accessible, authentic, warm, smart, confident, frank, authoritative, amusing, professional, fun, and positive
- **Avoid** sounding corporate, formal, hyperbolic, cold, smart-ass, arrogant, crass, superior, inappropriate, stuffy, goofy, or fear-mongering

## Proof-Driven Storytelling
- Highlight our improved SOC outcomes, 24/7/365 U.S.-based experts, and high analyst retention.
- Lead with customer impact first, then describe the technology, process, and people that make it possible.
- When referencing MDR, emphasize proactive + reactive coverage, flexible deployment, and human-driven investigation.

## Boilerplate
Use the official boilerplate in `boilerplate.md` for press releases, sales decks, website footers, and anywhere a formal description is needed. Never edit line breaks, numbers, or claims without approval from Brand.
