# Visual Identity

## Graphic Elements
- Favor a simple dark-blue to light-blue gradient in tight spaces where photography or patterns create clutter.
- Reserve secondary colors for purposeful accents, such as call-to-action buttons or data highlights.
- Keep layouts clear so copy remains the hero and the design underscores transparency.

## Color Palette
### Primary
- `#009CDE`
- `#004C97`
- `#343741`

### Secondary
- `#702F8A`
- `#EF3340`
- `#FF6A14`

### Gradient
- `#009CDE → #004C97`

## Logo Usage
- Minimum width: 80 px on-screen; never smaller than 1 inch in print.
- Maintain clear space equal to the height of the letter “C” on all sides. No other graphic element may intrude into this zone.
- Place the logo on solid or low-noise backgrounds to preserve legibility.

## Typography
- Primary typeface: Roboto across headlines, subheads, and body copy.
- Alternate corporate stack: Arial Black for headlines and Arial Narrow for body copy when Roboto is unavailable.
- Align typography with the voice—clean, readable, and unpretentious.

## CTA Guidance
- Use secondary colors for buttons or interactive states to create contrast against the primary palette.
- Ensure WCAG-compliant contrast ratios when pairing color and text weights.
