# Brand Persona

What we say is as important as how we say it. Use this table to gut-check copy and creative concepts.

| We Are | We Aren’t |
| --- | --- |
| Human | Corporate |
| Accessible | Formal |
| Authentic | Hyperbolic |
| Warm | Cold |
| Smart | Smart-ass |
| Confident | Arrogant |
| Frank | Crass |
| Authoritative | Superior |
| Amusing | Inappropriate |
| Professional | Stuffy |
| Fun | Goofy |
| Positive | Trying to scare the crap out of you |

Keep the “We Are” column as your north star. Anything that drifts toward the right column needs to be rewritten or redesigned.
