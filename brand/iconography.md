# Iconography

Icons help users scan security content quickly—use them sparingly and with intent.

## Style
- Choose outlined icons with a medium-thick stroke weight so they remain legible at small sizes.
- Apply accent colors or the primary bright blue (`#009CDE`) for consistency with the palette.
- Maintain equal padding and align icons with typographic baselines for clean layouts.

## Usage
- Treat icons as navigational or explanatory aids, not decorations.
- Pair each icon with a short label to reinforce meaning.
- When space is limited, prioritize clarity over illustration detail.

## Implementation Notes
- Use FA7 React icons (Font Awesome 7 React) to keep the library consistent across digital experiences.
- Ensure SVGs and icon fonts inherit currentColor so dark modes and theming remain flexible.
