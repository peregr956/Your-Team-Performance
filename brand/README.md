# CRITICALSTART Brand System

This folder centralizes the identity guidance for CRITICALSTART®. Each Markdown file is standalone and can be shared with designers, writers, and partners.

## File Map
- `overview.md` – summarizes the mission, vision, values, and the promise we make to customers.
- `voice.md` – defines how we speak, including usage rules and the boilerplate.
- `headline-examples.md` – ready-to-use headline inspiration organized by message pillar.
- `visual-identity.md` – color palette, gradients, typography, logo usage, and graphic elements.
- `persona.md` – quick reference for how we show up versus what to avoid.
- `iconography.md` – acceptable icon styles and implementation notes.
- `boilerplate.md` – approved corporate description for press, sales decks, and web copy.

Use Oxford commas, spell out acronyms on first reference, and treat "Cybersecurity" as one word per the language guidance.
